**Fretboard Compass** is a professional-grade Music Theory Suite for guitarists. It transforms complex intervals, exotic scales, and chord progressions into printable, "Binder-Ready" practice materials.

Designed for students and teachers, it takes the guesswork out of the fretboard by mathematically calculating every note and fingering.

## Key Features

### Pro Theory Engine
- **Analytical Triad Building:** Dynamically constructs Major, Minor, Diminished, Augmented, and Suspended chords from any 7-note scale.
- **Harmonic Borrowing:** Smart logic for presets (like Flamenco and Jazz) that prioritizes musicality over robotic diatonicism.
- **Dynamic Roman Numerals:** Context-aware Nashville numbering that handles accidentals (bII, #IV) and proper casing (I vs i).

### Visual Fretboard Mastery
- **Positional Zoning:** The neck is divided into three high-contrast color zones (Zone 1: Black, Zone 2: Blue, Zone 3: Purple) to help students master one "neighborhood" at a time.
- **Diamond Roots:** Instant geometric identification of the scale root across the entire 12-fret map.
- **CAGED System:** Automatically finds standard movable shapes for any chord, anywhere on the neck.

### Interactive Discovery
- **Proven Winners:** A dashboard of 20 timeless chord/scale combinations (e.g. "The Anthem," "Cinematic Doom," "12-Bar Shuffle") with play-style tips.
- **Favorites System:** Save your custom "vibes" with Titles and Descriptions (e.g. "bridge pickup settings"). Persistent JSON storage for easy recall.
- **Solver Sync:** Entering a manual progression now automatically updates the Note and Mood dropdowns to match the detected theory.
- **One Neighborhood Guide:** A built-in, printable practice manual for mastering the neck in 30 minutes a day.

## Architecture & Theory Logic

To balance musicality with mathematics, the suite follows a three-tier logic system:

### 1. Hard-Coded Data (The "Fixed" Knowledge)
These are the foundational "atoms" of the system:
- **Scale Intervals:** Semitone patterns for 15+ scales (Major, Minor, Dorian, etc.).
- **Chord Patterns:** Semitone offsets for basic chord types (Major, Minor, 7, Maj7, m7, dim, aug, m7b5).
- **Guitar Voicing Templates:** A database of ~30 `STANDARD_VOICINGS` (Open chords) and `MOVABLE_VOICINGS` (CAGED barre shapes) ensures that suggested fingerings are physically playable and musically common.

### 2. Heuristics (The "Best Guess" Logic)
The "suggestions" use weighted scoring to feel more like a human teacher:
- **Key Detection:** Favors the first chord entered (**+15% Tonic Bias**) and standard Major/Minor scales (**+5% Commonality Bonus**).
- **Fingering Selection:** Prioritizes "Standard" open chords at Fret 1 and "Movable" barre shapes for higher positions, falling back to a "Positional Solver" greedy algorithm as a last resort.

### 3. Truly Dynamic (Mathematical) Logic
These are calculated from scratch every time:
- **Nashville Numbering:** Dynamically compares chord roots to scale benchmarks to handle complex accidentals (#IV, bVII) and proper casing.
- **Triad Building:** "Walks" any 7-note scale to build chords mathematically (1-3-5) based on internal intervals.
- **Scale Mapping:** Checks every fret on the guitar against the calculated scale notes to generate the 12-fret master map.
