# Project Specification: Commercial Cloud Deployment (Monetized)

## 1. Objective
Transform the **Fretboard Compass Music Theory Suite** into a professional SaaS (Software as a Service) hosted on **Cloudflare Pages + Workers**, featuring usage-based throttling and newsletter/payment integration.

---

## 2. Commercial Tech Stack

### **Computing: Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript)**
- **Edge Runtime:** Migrate Python `engine.py` logic to a high-performance TypeScript `theory.ts` module.
- **Benefits:** Sub-millisecond execution, native integration with Cloudflare KV, and superior cold-start performance.

### **Database & Throttling: Cloudflare KV (Key-Value)**
- **Session Management:** Store encrypted session tokens for user authentication.
- **Usage Throttling:** Track generations per user email (e.g., `user:limit:2024-04-14`).
- **Gatekeeping:** Return HTMX "Upsell" partials when daily limits are reached.

### **Monetization Engine: Stripe + Newsletter Hooks**
- **Stripe Checkout:** Handle "Pro" subscriptions ($5/mo) for unlimited generations and advanced Jazz voicings.
- **Newsletter Webhooks:** Automatically grant "Subscriber" tier access (10 generations/day) when a user joins the mailing list (Substack/Beehiiv).

## 3. Deployment Architecture

### **Frontend: Cloudflare Pages**
- **Assets:** Pre-compiled Tailwind CSS, static HTML, and local HTMX library.
- **Performance:** Global CDN delivery with zero-latency asset serving.

### **Security: Custom Auth Worker**
- **Authentication:** Passwordless "Magic Link" (Email OTP) system.
- **Identity:** Direct integration with Cloudflare Access for Admin functions.

## 4. Porting Strategy

### **Phase 1: Theory Port**
- Translate `SCALES`, `CHORD_TYPES`, and `PROGRESSION_PRESETS` constants to TypeScript.
- Implement `TriadBuilder` class to replace `get_chord_from_degree` with identical mathematical logic.

### **Phase 2: UI Adaptation**
- Update `index.html` to point to `/api/generate`.
- Replace Flask Jinja2 templates with Worker-compatible template literals or pre-rendered partials.

### **Phase 3: Launch**
- Connect custom domain (e.g., `sheets.guitarpractice.com`).
- Enable Cloudflare WAF "Bot Fight Mode" to protect SVG assets.
